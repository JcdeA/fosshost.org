Fosshost is delighted to announce that it is working closely with [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/) to provide cloud infrastructure to the project. Rocky Linux is led by Gregory Kurtzer. The project intends to be a downstream, complete binary-compatible release, fork of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system source code.

Our support  will be in the form of several resources, primarily based out of the Equinix DA2 facility, thanks to our sponsor [Equinix Metal](https://metal.equinix.com/). These resources include a total provision of 400 Gigs of RAM, 102 cores, fast storage, and secure boot support. They will be provisioned across our x86 and AArch64 platforms, thanks to a recent donation made by Ampere Computing.

Fosshost is, naturally, extremely happy to be able to support Rocky Linux and its mission, and we look forward to what the future brings.
