OSUOSL have kindly donated a dedicated server to the fosshost project which will become Node 11.  This node will be hosted within the OSL campus in Corvallis, Oregon.

The OSUOSL lab, in partnership with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University, provides hosting for more than 160 projects, including those of worldwide leaders like the Apache Software Foundation, the Linux Foundation and Drupal. Together, the OSLâ€™s hosted sites deliver nearly 430 terabytes of information to people around the world every month. The most active organization of its kind, the OSL offers world-class hosting services, professional software development and on-the-ground training for promising students interested in open source management and programming.

We will in turn return the support shown and support OSUOSL with a dedicated UK node.  The donation and working together with OSUOSL, is a new partnership that will benefit the wider open source community particularly within Europe and we are looking at how we can work more closely to work on similar objectives. 

The donation by [OSUOSL](https://osuosl.org) is extremely kind, thank you Lance Albertson.
